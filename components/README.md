## [Bottom Drawer](bottom-drawer)
A React-Native wrapper component that is fixed to the bottom of another 
component. It can be open/close by dragging the top bar to display/hide 
its child components. 

The header can be customised by passing in a custom component with its 
own style and functionality.

The component keeps track of its own `close` and `open` states, optional 
callbacks can be passed in to be called during state changes.

The `close` and `open` state for the component can also be triggered 
programmatically by passing in the relevant props.
